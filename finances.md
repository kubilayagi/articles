## Preparing for Retirement
### Types of Accounts:
#### Roth IRA
- Tax Free when you pull it out when you retire, but it is not tax deductible for the current year
- max contribution:  $6,000

#### Traditional IRA
- Tax deductible for this fiscal year, taxed normally(?) when you pull it out when you retire.
- max contribution:  $6,000

It is important to note that the $6,000 contribution is across all accounts together. For example, if you contribute $4,000 to your Roth, you can only contribute $2,000 to your traditional IRA or to your Roth. If you contribute a total of more than $6,000, you will face an over-contribution penalty from the IRS. This fee is 6% of the excess, compounded every year that the excess remains. 

#### 401K
- For full time employees
- Companies generally offer to match a certain percentage of your salary
- max yearly contribution $19,000, but this can change from year to year


### Strategy For Investing in these:
- Max out 401K up to the amount that your company will match
    - For example, if your company matches 3% of your salary, deposit 3% of your salary into the 401K and receive the match
- Then max out your IRAs under the conditions specified above
    - Putting money into the traditional IRA allows you to get a tax refund for this year.
    - Putting money into the Roth IRA allows you to pull out the money when you retire tax free
