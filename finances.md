## Preparing for Retirement
### Types of Accounts:
#### Roth IRA
- Tax Free when you pull it out when you retire
- max contribution:  $6,000

#### Traditional IRA
- Tax deductible for this fiscal year
- max contribution:  $6,000

#### 401K
- For full time employees
- Companies generally offer to match a certain percentage of your salary
- max yearly contribution $19,000, but this can change from year to year


### Strategy For Investing in these:
- Max out 401K up to the amount that your company will match
- Max out traditional IRA (if you want more money now bc tax deductable)
- Max out Roth IRA (if you want more money at retirement)
