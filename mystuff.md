# Where I'm at

This is more of a checklist and plan type of document. Take it as a point of reference, but do your own thing!

### Credit Cards
#### What I have now:
- [x] Charles Schwab Investor Credit Card
    - American Express
    - 1.5% cash back on everything, automatically deposited back into the account I opened it with
    - No annual fee
    - $100 bonus after spending $1000 in first 3 months


#### Cards that I want to have (short term, within ~2-3 years):
- [ ] Wells Fargo Propel Credit Card
    - American Express
    - 20000 points ($200) when you spend $1000 in first 3 months
    - 3x points on gas, transportation, flights, hotels, dining
    - 1x on everything else (but we don't care about that)
    - No annual fee
    - Can only redeem cash back in $25 increments
    - Reasoning: the majority of my current expenses come from food and gas. With regular cash back credit cards, I'm missing out on extra points
    - Stipulations:
        - you can only get cash back dollars in increments of $25. Assuming you are maximizing the benefits of this card and getting 3%, you need to spend $833.33 before you can cash out on your rewards
        - wells fargo has all kinds of shady things going on in the background. TODO: I am going to check whether I can get the card without having to open up any extra wells fargo accounts. wells fargo has a nasty habit of charging you with fees when you don't have funds in your accounts, so if this is the case, I am looking at the CapitalOne SavorOne card for dining, and i'll have to find a different one for gas and travel

- [ ] Citi Bank Double Cash Credit Card
    - Mastercard
    - 2% on every purchase (for us since we pay off all of our credit card bills and don't carry a balance :) ). The official terms say: get 1% when you buy, another 1% when you pay your balance (on everything)
    - No annual fee
    - Reasoning: 2% is better than 1.5%

- [ ] Chase Freedom Credit Card
    - Visa
    - 5% cash back on rotating categories
    - 1% cash back otherwise
    - No annual fee
    - Reasoning: If I can get 5% some quarters on stuff that I normally get 2-3% on regularly, I'm going to take that opportunity

- [ ] Blue Cash Everyday Card
    - American Express
    - 3% back on grocery stores
    - 2% back on gas and certain department stores
    - 1% on everything else
    - No annual fee
    - Reasoning: the other cards cover everything except groceries
    - Stipulations:
        - you can only redeem your rewards once you've passed the $25 mark, although they don't required you to have 

#### Cards that I'll get later (next ~5-7 years)
- [ ] Apple Credit Card
    - 3% cash back on apple products and with select merchants
    - 2% cash back on everything when you use apple pay
    - Reasoning: I plan on buying apple products for the foreseeable future, so I might as well get more rewards for spending money on those products

- [ ] Uber Credit Card
    - Unfortunately cash back comes as uber cash, so it can only be used with uber products
    - But there's no annual fee so who cares :)
    - Reasoning: this one is not essential, but if I'm going to take Uber anyways, I'd rather get 5% back every time that I ride. This also gives 5% cash back on Uber eats, which is what I would switch to instead of DoorDash when I get this card.

#### Cards that might actually make sense to pay annual fee
- [ ] Blue Cash Preferred Card
    - American Express
    - 6%(!) at grocery stores
    - 6% on streaming services
    - 3% on transit
    - 3% on gas
    - 1% on everything else

#### Timeline:
I want to get as many of these cards as soon as possible so that I can be as efficient with my money as possible


#### Cards that are on my radar
- [ ] CapitalOne SavorOne
