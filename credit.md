# Credit For College Students and New Grads

## What is Credit?

You've almost definitely heard the words "credit card" or "credit score" at some point in your life. Credit is essentially borrowing money from a bank to make purchases, and then repaying the bank for the amount that you spend. Unfortunately, it's not just free money; you actually need to pay what you use credit for. 


So you might be asking yourself, if I'm going to be paying for the products myself anyways, why do I need a credit card. There are several reasons why using a credit card is better than paying with cash or debit card.


- Many credit cards offer benefits for using them. The simplest reward that they can offer is a certain percentage cash back on different purchases. Getting cash back means that everytime you spend money, you will get a certain percentage of your purchase back as a reward from the bank. Some cards offer a uniform percentage (e.g. 1.5% on every purchase). Others might offer different percentages for different categories. Some even have rotating categories (e.g. 4% on gas one quarter, 4% on groceries next quarter).

- Using credit cards (and paying off the balances !important) helps build credit. As you show that you are capable of paying off what you borrow from the bank, your credit score increases and your reputation improves. This reputation is what banks use in order to gauge whether or not they want to grant you loans or approve you for a credit card through them. (Wait, I need credit to get credit?  More on that later). Building your credit reputation becomes especially important when you apply for loans for bigger purchases, such as cars or homes. 

- Carrying around a credit card is much safer than carrying a debit card. A debit card is essentially having your entire bank account in your pocket. If someone takes your card and makes purchases, that money is gone from your account and you cannot get it back. With credit cards on the other hand, the money you use to purchase things does not immediately come out of your bank account. Therefore, if someone makes purchases on your card that you did not approve, you can call the credit card company and refute a charge. This lets them know that you did not make the purchase, and they will take you through the process to cancel that charge. Companies such as American Express have been known to be good with refuting transactions and protecting their customers in these situations.
    - IMPORTANT NOTE: BEING ABLE TO REFUTE CHARGES DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD COMMIT FRAUD.


- Though the three points above are the main attraction of credit cards, the companies that you open accounts with can offer additional perks. Sometimes, companies will offer coupons to their customers. Other perks can be things like access to lounges at airports, personal help getting reservations or tickets to sometimes exclusive events, etc. The higher end and more enticing perks usually come with cards with higher annual fees though, so keep in mind that you are technically still paying for these services.

## Where Do I Even Start

### Picking a card
It's likely that you did not learn about things like opening credit card accounts, paying taxes, preparing for retirement, etc. in school. It can be hard to know where to start, so hopefully this can be a bouncing off point. The starting point is different for many people, so let us break it down into different scenarios.

#### I am a college student with savings or some kind of income. I have never had a credit card, this article is the first time I've ever seen the word credit:

If you are this type of person, you should look to apply for a secured credit card. This card is primarily used to build credit for people who are new to credit. The way this credit card works is that you give the bank a security deposit of some amount which becomes your credit limit. Normal credit cards do not require a security deposit. The reason this type of card has it is because they know the people they take on might be riskier in terms of their ability to pay off their credit balance. If you are unable to pay, then they'll take the leftover balance from your security deposit. You should double check with the bank that they give your security deposit back at some point before you apply for the card.

If you open a secured credit card account, and you pay off all your balances on time, etc. you will probably be good to go to apply to a new credit card in about 6 months. 

#### I am a high school/college student and my parents pay for most of my stuff

If this is you (or this is your sibling), then you (they, you get the point) should consider asking your parents to open a credit card and add you as an authorized user. An authorized user is someone who has access to another person's credit card, but the primary user is the one that pays off the balances when the credit statements come. [Depending on the card](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/credit-card-authorized-users-build-credit/), and whether they report authorized users to the credit bureaus, every time your parent pays off the balance, it should build your credit reputation and score. 

#### I am an authorized user under a parent's account (a.k.a. my parents gave me a credit card to use that they pay for)

In this case, [depending on the card](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/credit-card-authorized-users-build-credit/), you may already be building your credit. If the card reports to the credit bureaus, you should be able to see your credit history on sites like [CreditKarma](creditkarma.com). Although the reputation you build by your parents paying off balances is less substantial with this method, having some credit history is much better than having none. Through this method, you should be able to apply to some cards with decent rewards programs right off the bat.

#### I don't have savings or a job

Instead of worrying about credit cards, you should be looking to save up a little cash by finding a job. You'll be pretty hard pressed to be accepted by even secured credit cards that you apply to without any money in the bank or 


### Application Process

Once you've decided which card you are applying to, the process is simple enough. If you're looking at cards on a third party website, they should have a link to apply on that card's website. If you're on the credit card company's page then there should be a link there to. If you don't feel as comfortable applying online, it's also possible to go to the bank itself and apply there with a person helping you. For the purpose of this post, I will assume you apply online. Once you've filled out the form and hit submit, there can be a few outcomes. Some banks will approve you within 30 seconds of your application, in which case you are good to go. I think there might be some cards that also can reject you on the spot as well, although I think this is less common. If you aren't approved immediately, then it will take a few weeks for them to review your credit reports and other stuff. They'll get back to you with either an acceptance or a rejection. If you're rejected, you might want to reevaluate your choice of credit card. Perhaps you should consider a secured card to build your credit first?

If it's your first credit card, then they might ask to confirm your entire social security number over the phone (if you don't apply through the bank itself). If they call you and ask for your entire SSN, don't give it to them because it might be a scam call that somehow knew that you applied for a card. The company will generally send you a welcome email after you first apply. Again, double check the domain of this email to make sure it is actually associated with the company and not a phishing email. Either confirm the email and use the phone number they give you there, or go onto the credit card company's official website and find a customer service number through the Contact Us page so that you can be sure that you are giving your SSN to trustworthy people.

## Important Points
- If you can avoid it, never leave a remaining balance in your account. Despite some rumors that I have heard, leaving a balance on your card DOES NOT IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT SCORE. The banks will give you a minimum balance that you need to pay off to indicate that you haven't missed a payment for that period. Your credit limit can be thousands of dollars, and the minimum payment can be something like $25. If you only pay the minimum payment and leave a balance in your account, the APR will be applied to your balance and will add more money to the balance that you need to pay. Theoretically, you can pay the minimum payment every period, and end the year owing more money than you did originally.

- Checking your credit score on sites like CreditKarma DOES NOT HURT YOUR CREDIT SCORE. The only time checking your score hurts your score is when the credit card companies run a "hard check" of your score. Credit card companies run a hard check when you apply for a credit card or a loan. They make a formal request to one of the credit bureaus to see your credit report. Hard checks can hurt your score for a few different reasons. The company might think you're applying because you need more credit since you're using too much of the limit you currently have. Also, the amount of time you've had your credit cards is averaged across all of your cards, so when you open a new one, the average time you've had the cards goes down. there may be other reasons as well

- Make sure you think twice about the annual fee that you're paying. The cost of the fee may outweigh the benefits that you get back. In some cases, credit cards will have a sign-on bonus that will pay for the annual fee for the first few years anyways. But again, just be careful

- Be aware of all the stipulations that come with redeeming your rewards. For example, most cash back can only be redeemed in increments of $25. So if you're getting 1.5% cash back from your spending, then you'll need to spend $1666.67 before you see any benefits.

- Make sure you know the conversion rates of points to dollars when you apply to a card. Sometimes points can be redeemed at a higher rate by using them through the credit card company's website to book hotels, flights, etc. instead of withdrawing the points as straight cash. 

- You should wait around 6 months between applying to different cards. It might look a bit suspicous if the credit card companies see that you applied to several credit cards simultaneously. Even if you get accepted by the ones you've applied to previously, you're more likely to get rejected from the new ones you're applying to without leaving a time gap in between. That's why when you're applying, make sure that the card you apply to fits your needs well. Whether that is building credit or getting cash back on groceries depends on your circumstances

- Avoid using more than 30% of your credit limit consistently. If you feel that you need more credit, then apply to another credit card so that you have a higher total credit limit. There is a new policy now for the scenario where you make a large purchase on your card and pay it off immediately before the statement comes out. In this scenario, it used to be that using a high percentage of your credit but paying it off immediately wouldn't hurt you. But with this new policy, credit companies do ding your for this now. Sometimes this is unavoidable, but it's just best to be aware of it. 

## What hurts/helps credit score?
#### Hurts
- Applying to get a credit card
    - If you get approved, you use the card, the hit to your credit score will eventually return to what it was/higher because you will be using a lower average percentage of your credit.
- Getting rejected when you apply
- Missing a payment (you don't make the minimum payment required)
- Using too high a percentage of your credit limit
- Closing an account (or not using an account for so long that the company closes it for you)

Credit: can't stand it, but can't live without it :) 

#### Helps
- Paying off your balances on time (again, try to pay off the entire balance so you don't get screwed by APR)
- That's pretty much it lol
