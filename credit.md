## What is Credit?

You've almost definitely heard the words "credit card" or "credit score" at some point in your life. Credit is essentially borrowing money from a bank to make purchases, and then repaying the bank for the amount that you spend. Unfortunately, it's not just free money; you actually need to pay what you use credit for. 


So you might be asking yourself, if I'm going to be paying for the products myself anyways, why do I need a credit card. There are several reasons why using a credit card is better than paying with cash or debit card.


- Many credit cards offer benefits for using them. The simplest reward that they can offer is a certain percentage cash back on different purchases. Getting cash back means that everytime you spend money, you will get a certain percentage of your purchase back as a reward from the bank. Some cards offer a uniform percentage (e.g. 1.5% on every purchase). Others might offer different percentages for different categories. Some even have rotating categories (e.g. 4% on gas one quarter, 4% on groceries next quarter).

- Using credit cards (and paying off the balances !important) helps build credit. As you show that you are capable of paying off what you borrow from the bank, your credit score increases and your reputation improves. This reputation is what banks use in order to gauge whether or not they want to grant you loans or approve you for a credit card through them. (Wait, I need credit to get credit?  More on that later). Building your credit reputation becomes especially important when you apply for loans for bigger purchases, such as cars or homes. 

- Carrying around a credit card is much safer than carrying a debit card. A debit card is essentially having your entire bank account in your pocket. If someone takes your card and makes purchases, that money is gone from your account and you cannot get it back. With credit cards on the other hand, the money you use to purchase things does not immediately come out of your bank account. Therefore, if someone makes purchases on your card that you did not approve, you can call the credit card company and refute a charge. This lets them know that you did not make the purchase, and they will take you through the process to cancel that charge. Companies such as American Express have been known to be good with refuting transactions and protecting their customers in these situations.
    - IMPORTANT NOTE: BEING ABLE TO REFUTE CHARGES DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD COMMIT FRAUD.


- Though the three points above are the main attraction of credit cards, the companies that you open accounts with can offer additional perks. Sometimes, companies will offer coupons to their customers. Other perks can be things like access to lounges at airports, personal help getting reservations or tickets to sometimes exclusive events, etc. The higher end and more enticing perks usually come with cards with higher annual fees though, so keep in mind that you are technically still paying for these services.



## Where Do I Even Start

It's likely that you did not learn about things like opening credit card accounts, paying taxes, preparing for retirement, etc. in school. It can be hard to know where to start, so hopefully this can be a bouncing off point. The starting point is different for many people, so let us break it down into different scenarios.

If you are this type of person, you should look to apply for a Secured Credit Card. This card is essentially a credit card with a down payment. This card is primarily used to build credit for people who are new to credit.

## Important Points
- If you can avoid it, never leave a remaining balance in your account. Despite some rumors that I have heard, leaving a balance on your card DOES NOT IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT SCORE. The banks will give you a minimum balance that you need to pay off to indicate that you haven't missed a payment for that period. Your credit limit can be thousands of dollars, and the minimum payment can be something like $25. If you only pay the minimum payment and leave a balance in your account, the APR will be applied to your balance and will add more money to the balance that you need to pay. Theoretically, you can pay the minimum payment every period, and end the year owing more money than you did originally.

- Checking your credit score on sites like CreditKarma DOES NOT HURT YOUR CREDIT SCORE. The only time checking your score hurts your score is when the credit card companies run a "hard check" of your score. Credit card companies run a hard check when you apply for a credit card or a loan. They make a formal request to one of the credit bureaus to see your credit report. The reason that a hard check hurts your score is because ...
